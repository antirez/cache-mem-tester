This small Ruby program tests the memory efficiency of Redis and Memcached
using a given distribution of values sizes, against 400 MB of used memory.

It was written because of the following thread in the Redis mailing list:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/redis-db/rmuO_gRWzUs

USAGE
---

Uncomment test_redis or test_memcache at the end of the memtestr.rb file
and execute the program.

When testing Redis, just start an instance using port 10000 with:

    ./redis-server --port 10000

When testing Memcached start the server with:

    ./memcached -m 400 -M

The -M switch is used to tell memcached to return errors when the 400 MB
of memory are full instead of start key eviction, this way the program has
a simple way to understand the server is full.

To test memcached a second time, you have to restart the server. This is not
needed for Redis (probably to fix this is trivial, pull requests accepted).
